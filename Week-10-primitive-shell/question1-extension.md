# this should be in next week , the extension of the prev assignment ...   

Please include **pipe (|)**, for example **"ls | more"** and IO redirection, for example **"./a.out <input.txt > output.txt** in the primitive shell that you have been constructing as part of the previous assignment. With respect to **pipe (|)**, start with the implementation for pipe between two subcommands (say, ls | more). Subsequently, go for general (**any number of pipes**, say, cmd1 | cmd2 | ... | cmdN) implementation.
