advanced part of prev question

This is an extension of the previous assignment, where there was only one producer process and one consumer process "working" on a shared circular queue. At a time the producer process could add only one item and the consumer process could "consume" only one item. We may start working on a copy of the programs you wrote for the previous assignment to incorporate the following.

There can be more than one producer and more than one consumer processes run independently (at different terminals).
At a time a producer process may add one or more (maximum 10) items to the queue and a consumer process too may "consume" one or more (maximum 10) items from the queue.
Your programs must be user-friendly and well-documented!
