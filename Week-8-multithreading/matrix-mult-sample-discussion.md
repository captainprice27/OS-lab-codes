## first code disccussion

This program demonstrates matrix multiplication using threads in C. The key points and issues in the code are:

Thread Creation: Threads are created for each element of the resulting matrix C. Each thread computes a single element of C. This approach aims to parallelize the computation of the matrix multiplication.

Data Passing to Threads: A structure struct v is defined to pass the indices i and j to each thread, indicating the element of C it should compute. The runner function takes a void * parameter and casts it to the struct v type to access the indices.

Thread Execution: The runner function is executed by each thread. It computes the corresponding element of C using the provided indices and stores the result.

Error Handling: Error handling is implemented for both pthread_create and pthread_join functions. The error codes are interpreted and corresponding error messages are printed.

Sequential Thread Creation and Joining: Threads are created and joined sequentially inside nested loops for i and j indices. This sequential nature limits the benefits of parallelism because the main thread waits for each thread to complete before creating the next one. Ideally, threads should be created in parallel and joined after all computations are done.

Memory Management: Memory allocated for the struct v passed to each thread is freed before the thread exits to avoid memory leaks.

Output Display: Finally, the resulting matrix C is displayed after all threads have finished their computations.

To improve the program's efficiency, you could revise the thread creation and joining process to be parallel, allowing threads to execute concurrently rather than sequentially. This could be achieved by creating all threads first and then joining them afterward. Additionally, you might consider optimizing the matrix multiplication algorithm itself for better performance.


## second code discussionn

This version of the program (matrixmult2.c) improves the parallelization of thread creation compared to matrixmult1.c. Here are the key points and improvements:

Parallel Thread Creation: In matrixmult2.c, all threads are created in parallel using nested loops. Each thread is responsible for computing a single element of the resulting matrix C. This approach takes advantage of parallelism by creating threads concurrently.

Data Passing to Threads: Similar to matrixmult1.c, a structure struct v is used to pass the indices i and j to each thread. This allows each thread to know which element of C it should compute.

Error Handling: Error handling for pthread_create and pthread_join functions remains the same as in matrixmult1.c.

Sequential Thread Joining: After creating all threads, the main thread waits for each thread to complete by using nested loops for joining. This ensures that the main thread doesn't proceed until all threads have finished their computations.

Memory Management: Memory allocated for the struct v passed to each thread is freed before the thread exits, as in matrixmult1.c.

Output Display: Finally, the resulting matrix C is displayed after all threads have finished their computations, similar to matrixmult1.c.

Overall, matrixmult2.c improves the parallelization aspect by creating all threads concurrently, which can lead to better performance compared to the sequential thread creation in matrixmult1.c. However, further optimizations could be made to enhance the efficiency of matrix multiplication, such as using more efficient algorithms or techniques for large matrices.

## sequential thread vs parallel thread

The terms "sequential thread" and "parallel thread" refer to how threads are created and executed within a program.

**Sequential Thread:** In a program with sequential threads, threads are created and executed one after the other, meaning each thread completes its execution before the next one starts. In this model, there's no concurrent execution of threads. Instead, the program follows a linear execution flow, and each thread is executed in a sequential manner, waiting for the previous thread to finish before starting its own execution.

**Parallel Thread:** In contrast, a program with parallel threads creates multiple threads that can execute concurrently. These threads are created simultaneously and can execute simultaneously if the underlying hardware supports it. This allows for concurrent execution of multiple tasks, potentially leading to improved performance and better utilization of multi-core processors.

To illustrate the difference:

**Sequential Thread Example:** In a sequential thread scenario, if a program has three threads (Thread A, Thread B, and Thread C), Thread A will start execution first. Once Thread A completes its task, Thread B will start execution, followed by Thread C. Each thread waits for the previous one to finish before it starts.

**Parallel Thread Example:**  In a parallel thread scenario, if a program has three threads (Thread A, Thread B, and Thread C), all three threads may start execution simultaneously (depending on the hardware and operating system capabilities). Each thread executes concurrently, independently of the others, and they may finish their tasks in any order.

In summary, sequential threads execute one after the other in a linear fashion, while parallel threads can execute simultaneously, leading to potential performance improvements in multi-threaded applications.
